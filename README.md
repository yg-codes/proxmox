## üöÄ Quick Start - Unified VM Manager

For the most comprehensive experience, start with the unified VM management script:

```bash
# Set up API authentication
export PVE_HOST=your-proxmox-host.com
export PVE_USER=your-username@pam
export PVE_TOKEN_NAME=your-token-name
export PVE_TOKEN_VALUE=your-token-value

# Grant permissions
pveum aclmod / -token 'your-username@pam!your-token-name' -role PVEVMAdmin

# Run the unified manager
./pve_vm_manager_api.py
```

### What You Can Do:

## üöÄ Installation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites for API Scripts

**IMPORTANT: Token Permissions Must Be Set BEFORE Using API Scripts**

If you plan to use the API-based scripts, you **MUST** configure proper permissions first, or the scripts will fail with "Permission check failed" errors.

```bash
# After creating your API token, IMMEDIATELY run this command:
pveum aclmod / -token 'your-username@pam!your-token-name' -role PVEVMAdmin

# Example:
pveum aclmod / -token 'admin@pam!snapshots' -role PVEVMAdmin
```

### API-Based Scripts (Recommended for New Deployments)

#### **Requirements**
```bash
# Install required Python packages
pip install requests urllib3

# Or using virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv proxmox-env
source proxmox-env/bin/activate
pip install requests urllib3
```

#### **Authentication Setup**

**Option 1: API Token (Recommended)**
1. **Create API Token in Proxmox Web UI:**
   - Go to Datacenter ‚Üí Permissions ‚Üí API Tokens
   - Click "Add" and create token for your user
   - Copy the token value (shown only once!)

2. **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Grant Required Permissions (MUST DO FIRST):**
```bash
# This step is REQUIRED - the token won't work without proper permissions
pveum aclmod / -token 'your-username@pam!your-token-name' -role PVEVMAdmin

# Example with actual values:
pveum aclmod / -token 'admin@pam!snapshots' -role PVEVMAdmin
```

3. **Set Environment Variables:**
```bash
export PVE_HOST=your-proxmox-host.com
export PVE_USER=your-username@pam
export PVE_TOKEN_NAME=your-token-name
export PVE_TOKEN_VALUE=your-token-value
```

**Option 2: Password Authentication**
- Scripts will prompt for credentials if environment variables are not set
- Less secure but simpler for testing

#### **Installation Steps**
```bash
# 1. Transfer all API scripts to Proxmox host
scp pve_vm_manager_api.py root@proxmox-host:/root/
scp pve_snapshot_*_api.py root@proxmox-host:/root/
scp pve_snapshots/pve_snapshot_delete_interactive.py root@proxmox-host:/root/

# 2. Make executable
chmod +x pve_vm_manager_api.py
chmod +x pve_snapshot_create_api.py
chmod +x pve_snapshot_rollback_api.py
chmod +x pve_snapshot_delete_api.py
chmod +x pve_snapshot_delete_interactive.py

# 3. Test connection
./pve_vm_manager_api.py --help
./pve_snapshot_create_api.py --help
```

### CLI-Based Scripts (Original Method)

1. **Transfer the Python scripts** to your Proxmox host using SCP/SFTP

2. **Make them executable**:
```bash
chmod +x pve_snapshot_create_cli.py
chmod +x pve_snapshot_delete_cli.py
chmod +x pve_snapshot_rollback_cli.py
```

3. **Create a convenient `python` command** (if not already available):
```bash
# Create symbolic link (recommended)
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/python
```

4. **Verify installation**:
```bash
python3 --version  # Should show Python 3.11.2 or higher
python --version   # Should now also show Python 3.x
```

### System Requirements
- **Proxmox VE environment**
- **Python 3.6+** (Python 3.11.2+ recommended)
- **For API scripts**: `requests` and `urllib3` Python packages
- **For CLI scripts**: Appropriate permissions to execute `qm` commands
- **Access to VM management operations**

```bash
# Required for token authentication
export PVE_HOST=proxmox.company.com       # Proxmox host/IP
export PVE_USER=snapshot@pve              # Username@realm
export PVE_TOKEN_NAME=automation          # Token name
export PVE_TOKEN_VALUE=abc123...          # Token value

```

#### **Token Permissions**
Minimum required roles for the API token:
- **PVEVMUser** - Basic VM operations
- **PVEVMAdmin** - Full VM management (recommended for all operations)
- **Sys.Audit** - Optional, for enhanced node information

```bash
# Grant permissions for all operations (VM management, snapshots, backups)
pveum aclmod / -token 'username@pam!token-name' -role PVEVMAdmin
```

#### **Bulk Operations Configuration**
```bash
# Concurrent operation limits (can be adjusted in scripts)
MAX_CONCURRENT_START_STOP=3    # VM start/stop operations

```

### CLI Scripts Examples

All CLI script examples remain valid. See previous documentation for detailed CLI usage examples.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### VM Manager Issues

**"No VMs found"**
- Check API permissions: `pveum aclmod / -token 'user@realm!token' -role PVEVMAdmin`
- Verify network connectivity to Proxmox nodes
- Check if VMs are on different nodes than expected

**"Bulk operation failed for some VMs"**
- Review the detailed failure summary displayed after bulk operations
- Check individual VM status and error messages
- Common causes: VM already in target state, insufficient resources, locked VMs

**"Backup restoration failed"**
- Ensure target storage has sufficient space
- Check VM protection mode (script will help disable if needed)
- Verify backup file integrity and permissions

**"Cannot access storage"**
- Verify storage is online and accessible from current node
- Check storage permissions and content type settings
- Try different node if storage is shared

### API Scripts Issues

**"API request failed: 403 Permission check failed" - MOST COMMON ISSUE**
- **ROOT CAUSE:** Token permissions not properly configured
- **SOLUTION:** Run the permission command immediately after creating your token:
```bash
# Replace with your actual username and token name
pveum aclmod / -token 'your-username@pam!your-token-name' -role PVEVMAdmin

# Examples:
pveum aclmod / -token 'admin@pam!snapshots' -role PVEVMAdmin
pveum aclmod / -token 'automation@pve!vm-management' -role PVEVMAdmin
```

**"No VMs found on selected nodes"**
- Run debug mode: Answer 'y' to "Run API debug analysis?"
- Check API permissions for VM listing
- Verify VMs exist on selected nodes

**"Task failed" (for any operation)**
- Check VM status matches operation requirements
- Verify sufficient disk space on nodes
- Review task logs in Proxmox web interface
- Check for locked VMs or ongoing operations

**"Cannot connect to API"**
- Verify PVE_HOST environment variable
- Check network connectivity to Proxmox host
- Verify API service is running (port 8006)

**"externally-managed-environment error"**
- Use virtual environment: `python3 -m venv proxmox-env && source proxmox-env/bin/activate`
- Or install system packages: `sudo apt install python3-requests`

### CLI Scripts Issues

**"Cannot execute 'qm list'"**
- Ensure you're running on a Proxmox host
- Check user permissions for VM management
- Verify Proxmox VE is properly installed

**"python: command not found"**
- Use `python3 pve_snapshot_create_cli.py` directly
- Or create symlink: `sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/python`

### Common Issues (All Scripts)

**"Snapshot name too long"**
- Use shorter prefixes (max 25 characters)
- The script will automatically truncate VM names intelligently

**"VM does not exist"**
- Verify VMID with `qm list` (CLI) or check API debug output
- Check VM accessibility and permissions

**"vmstate ignored - VM stopped"**
- This is normal behavior - vmstate can only be saved for running VMs
- Start the VM if you need to save its state

### Best Practices

**Choose the right script:**
- **Use VM Manager** for: Interactive management, bulk operations, comprehensive VM lifecycle
- **Use API scripts** for: Automation, specific snapshot operations, remote management
- **Use CLI scripts** for: Simple setups, minimal dependencies, direct server access

**Authentication security:**
- Use API tokens instead of passwords for automation
- Set appropriate token permissions (principle of least privilege)
- Store credentials in environment variables, not in scripts

**Performance optimization:**
- Use vmstate only when necessary (exact point-in-time recovery)
- Consider network and storage impact for large VMs
- Schedule bulk operations during maintenance windows
- Adjust concurrent operation limits based on hardware capabilities

**Operation safety:**
- Always review configurations before destructive operations
- Use bulk operations carefully with appropriate confirmations
- Test operations in non-production environments first
- Create snapshots before major changes
- Monitor bulk operation progress and results

**Maintenance best practices:**
- Regularly clean up old snapshots and backups to save storage
- Document snapshot naming conventions
- Use consistent prefixes for easy identification
- Monitor storage space usage
- Set up automated cleanup for old backups
